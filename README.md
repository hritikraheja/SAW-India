>SAW is the abbreviation of 'Stray Animal Welfare'. 
As we all see the below listed things in our day to day life : 
- Stray animals nearby houses often get hurt and need our help, but most of times, we are not able to do so. The only thing we can do is to put some food and water, and leave them for god’s help.
- We see bulls on the highway which gets knocked down by the passing vehicles and many other problems.
- In some areas, there are animal health centers which are fully functional, but  in most cities, which are not so developed, you will not be able to find such centers
- In many cities, where these shelters are present, people are not able to get their contact details on time.
- Many such healthcare centers have a constant complain that people are not aware about their presence, and they are not able to reach creature in need.This creates a gap between the organizations and the people.

In order to release the pain of injured stray animals, I have created this application that will work in the below described way-
- With my solution the gap between the animal healthcare centers and common people will be bridged.
- People who see a suffering animal nearby, can directly open the app and upload a picture of the animal, along with their names, mobile number and the description of the problem that the animal is facing. The app would get the users location on its own.
- This help request would be uploaded on the server and the software would animal help centers nearby the user’s location and allot a animal helper for that animal.
- The animal helper will open his app(which is different from the user’s app), and will reach the location, just like swiggy/zomato delivery partners reaching our homes.
- This app will also contains feeds that will contain videos and photos of animal that will be helped at that time , this would create awareness among the people.
- The app will also have a payment gateway, which will pave the way for donations that will be very much helpful for the organizations.
